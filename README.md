This repository contains the classic Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples of iris flowers across 
three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: 
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Objective:
Perform Statistical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution, 
relationships, and summary statistics of the dataset. This includes:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, std dev)
- Distribution plots (histogram, boxplot, density)
- Correlation analysis
- Comparative analysis across species

 Files:
- `iris.csv` → Dataset
- `Statistics and EDA.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with EDA steps

Use Case:
This dataset serves as a beginner-friendly resource for learning data analysis, visualization, 
and statistical insights in Python.
